# RevitAutomation

This Repository looks at using Transformer Networks to generate a more automated workflow inside of Revit. Family saving is reworked so that elements are automatically sorted by Masterformat Division, and simplified to standard Object Style Subcategories at no effort from the designer. The Categories are predetermined in enumerators in the code base.
